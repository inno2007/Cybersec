# Introduction to Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity refers to the protection of systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, damage, or disruption. It plays a critical role in safeguarding digital infrastructure, especially in an increasingly connected world.

## Key Concepts

### Cybersecurity vs Information Security

- **Information Security** focuses on protecting all forms of data (physical or digital).
- **Cybersecurity** is a subset focused on securing **digital systems** and **networks** from cyber threats.

## Security Goals (CIA Triad)

| Goal             | Description                                               |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Confidentiality  | Ensure data is accessible only by authorized users.       |
| Integrity        | Ensure data is accurate and unaltered.                   |
| Availability     | Ensure systems and data are available when needed.       |

## Common Types of Cyber Attacks

| Attack Type           | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **Malware**            | Malicious software like viruses, worms, ransomware. |
| **Phishing**           | Fake emails or sites tricking users into revealing credentials. |
| **Man-in-the-Middle**  | Attacker intercepts communication between two parties. |
| **SQL Injection**      | Inserting SQL code to manipulate or steal from a database. |
| **Denial of Service**  | Overloading a server to make it unavailable to users. |

## Vulnerabilities and Threats

- **Vulnerability**: A weakness in a system (e.g., outdated software, poor configuration).
- **Threat**: A potential event that could exploit a vulnerability (e.g., hacker, malware).
- **Risk** = Vulnerability × Threat × Impact

---

## Common Vulnerability Points

- Weak passwords
- Lack of software updates (patches)
- Open ports and misconfigured firewalls
- Social engineering / user error
- Unsecured Wi-Fi or network connections

---

## Security Measures

- Use of **encryption** for data confidentiality
- **Access control** and **authentication mechanisms** (passwords, MFA)
- **Firewalls** and **intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS)**
- Regular software **updates** and **security audits**
- Security **awareness training** for users

## Example Scenarios

1. A university database is leaked because of an unpatched vulnerability → **Failure of confidentiality**
2. A file is modified without authorization → **Integrity breach**
3. A website is taken down by a DDoS attack → **Availability compromise**
