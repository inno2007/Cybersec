## 🔐 Password Cracking

Performed dictionary-based and rules-based cracking using **John the Ripper**:
- Cracked weak passwords using wordlists
- Analyzed hash complexity and cracking speed
- Discussed modern password security best practices

**Tools:** John the Ripper, Kali Linux  
**Skills:** Password security, hash cracking, wordlist logic

---

## 💉 SQL Injection

Simulated attacks against insecure login systems using SQLi techniques:
- Bypassed authentication using injection payloads
- Extracted database content
- Tested string-based and boolean-based injection patterns

**Tools:** MySQL, PHP test pages  
**Skills:** Injection logic, authentication bypass, SQL manipulation

---

## 🌐 DNS Spoofing & Cache Poisoning

Executed DNS attacks to redirect users and hijack domains:
- Spoofed DNS responses to client machines
- Performed DNS cache poisoning on servers
- Simulated malicious site redirection

**Tools:** Ettercap, Kali Linux  
**Skills:** DNS spoofing, host file manipulation, redirection attacks

---

## 🔐 OpenSSL, PKI & Certificates

Configured public key encryption using **OpenSSL** and **GPG**:
- Generated key pairs and encrypted/decrypted files  
- Became a **Root Certificate Authority (CA)**
- Created X.509 certificates and signed them for secure websites  
- Configured HTTPS using PKI for `cybersec.com.au`

**Tools:** OpenSSL, GPG, Apache  
**Skills:** PKI, TLS/SSL, certificate signing, trust chains

---

## 🧨 SYN Flooding, ARP Poisoning & ICMP Attacks

Simulated DoS and redirection attacks at network level:
- **SYN flood** attacks to exhaust server connections
- **ARP cache poisoning** for redirection and session hijack
- **ICMP Redirect** and **Source-Quench** attacks

**Tools:** Netwox, Wireshark, CLI  
**Skills:** Packet crafting, spoofing, DoS simulation

---

## 📡 Telnet, SSH & Blind Injection Attacks

Attacked insecure remote protocols:
- Captured Telnet credentials in transit
- Simulated SSH-based access control bypass
- Executed **ICMP blind connection-reset** and **source-quench** denial attacks

**Tools:** Wireshark, Netcat, CLI  
**Skills:** Protocol sniffing, remote session hijacking, denial-of-service

---

## 🚨 Snort IDS Configuration

Installed and configured **Snort** as an intrusion detection system:
- Wrote custom rules to detect scanning, brute force, and FTP logins
- Tuned alert thresholds and validated output logs
- Analyzed packet headers and traffic patterns

**Tools:** Snort, tcpdump, Wireshark  
**Skills:** IDS rule writing, alert filtering, real-time traffic analysis

---

## 🎣 Phishing & Social Engineering

Created and tested phishing campaigns:
- Used **Zphisher** to deploy fake login pages
- Hosted phishing sites using **000webhost**
- Simulated email-based and homograph attacks
- Gathered device info via mobile OS tools (Termux, iSH)

**Tools:** Zphisher, 000webhost, Termux, Kali Linux  
**Skills:** Social engineering, phishing, URL spoofing

---

## 🔒 Firewall Policies with Juniper OS

Configured network access policies in **Juniper OS**:
- Created and tested security policies for traffic filtering
- Simulated access control and service restrictions

**Tools:** Juniper CLI, Virtual Router  
**Skills:** Stateful firewalling, policy creation, service control

---

## 🔑 Juniper Firewall User Authentication

Simulated user authentication through firewalls:
- Implemented pass-through user authentication  
- Verified login prompts and session control  
- Simulated user-level filtering of traffic through a firewall

**Tools:** Juniper CLI  
**Skills:** Firewall user auth, login filtering, session management
